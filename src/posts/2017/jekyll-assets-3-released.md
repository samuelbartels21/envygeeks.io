Today, Jekyll Assets 3.0.0 has been released ðŸŽ‚. It involved a major rewrite, for
a sponsored feature (SourceMaps,) and a major speed boost, with a major boost to
people's ability to make plugins that hook into Jekyll-Assets, in the future.
Here is what's new:

<!-- MORE -->

## One Tag to Rule Them All

We've removed `{% css %}`, `{% link %}`, `{% img %}`, and any other tag, and
left only one tag to rule them all `{% asset %}`, since Sprockets 4 now requires
you to add an extension for most asset searching, it's no longer necessary for
us to carry multiple tags to set a series of basic content types, we now have a
single tag that deals with everything, including determining content type.

## Super Fast

Like the movie, but less funny, and less dumb (in all fairness it wasn't meant
to be a serious movie).  Now our system caches much better, we use the manifest
more, we more efficiently process, and just, yeah see it for yourself.

```shell
Configuration file: /srv/jekyll/_config.yml
            Source: ./source
       Destination: ./site
 Incremental build: disabled. Enable with --incremental
      Generating... done in 6.133 seconds.
 Auto-regeneration: enabled for './source'
 LiveReload Server: http://0.0.0.0:35729
    Server address: http://0.0.0.0:4000
  Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
      Regenerating: 1 file(s) changed at 2017-11-21 11:03:32
        ...done in 2.424920382 seconds.
```

## Drop in replacement

We now support being a direct drop-in replacement for Jekyll's own basic asset
processing, but unlike Jekyll, we put the power in your hands, as Jekyll Assets
is truly hackable, and extensible, like Jekyll Core, but compared to Jekyll's
very basic asset system, we give you flexibility.

***ðŸŽ‰ We now strip `---\n---`, which Jekyll uses to determine assets... ðŸŽ‰***

### Default Sources

- assets/css
- assets/fonts
- assets/images
- assets/videos
- assets/javascript
- assets/video
- assets/image
- assets/img
- assets/js
- \_assets/css
- \_assets/fonts
- \_assets/images
- \_assets/videos
- \_assets/javascript
- \_assets/video
- \_assets/image
- \_assets/img
- \_assets/js
- css
- fonts
- images
- videos
- javascript
- video
- image
- img
- js

## Sprockets 4.x Support

By default we still default to Sprockets 3.x but now we also support Sprockets
4.x if you are looking for some speed boosts (trust me, it's worth it.) It also
enables some of our other features, like SourceMaps, and other features.

```ruby
gem "sprockets", "4.0.beta"
```

## Responsive Image Support

This has been a long standing request from the community.  To support responsive
images.  Prior to this rewrite, it would have been a huge undertaking because I
never designed 2.x to do the kind of stuff I designed 3.x to do.  Now you can do
basic responsive images (and kick on your own advanced responsiveness by going
manual on `media` and `sizes`).  You can learn more about how it works here:
https://github.com/envygeeks/jekyll-assets#responsive-images

### Example

```liquid
{% asset img.png @pic
    srcset:max-width="800 2x"
    srcset:max-width="600 1.5x"
    srcset:max-width="400 1x"
      %}
```

#### Result

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="1.png 2x"   media="(max-width:800px)">
  <source srcset="2.png 1.5x" media="(max-width:600px)">
  <source srcset="3.png 1x"   media="(max-width:400px)">
  <img src="img.png">
</picture>
````

### Example

```liquid
{% asset img.png
    srcset:width="400 1x"
    srcset:width="600 1.5x"
    srcset:width="800 2x"
      %}

{% asset img.png
    srcset:width=400
    srcset:width=600
    srcset:width=800
      %}
```

#### Result

```html
<img srcset="1.png   2x, 2.png 1.5x, 3.png   1x">
<img srcset="1.png 400w, 2.png 600w, 3.pnx 800w">
```

## Support for `<video>` and `<audio>`

Sprockets 4 brought better `audio/*` and `video/*` support.  We now support
consuming any supported content type, and pushing out a `<video>` or `<audio>`,
we've even let you customize the attributes that get passed to them.

## Support for fast `cp`, with `raw_precompile`

in 2.x we had no ability to allow you to quickly copy assets you didn't need to
go through the pipline, but wanted inside of your assets folder, this is
particularly useful for cases of Emoji systems, where they provide a super huge
set of images, but precompiling all those assets even at their most basic
through the pipeline is expensive.  You can `cp` these asses quickly now with
Jekyll Assets by configuring your project like the following:

```yaml
assets:
  raw_precompile:
  - twemoji/2/svg/1f3c3-1f3fb-200d-2640-fe0f.svg
  - src: twemoji/2/svg/*.svg
    dst: twemoji
```

## Support for native `<img asset>`

Tired of not being able to see your assets when working in Atom Editor or any
other editor that has support for markdown previews?  We now support the native
image tag with a custom attribute, `<img asset>`. So you can see our assets
before they are processed, and then as your site processed, we transform that,
it even works with proxies!

### Example

```html
<img src="asset.png" asset>
<img src="asset.png" asset="magick:resize=400">
```

## Better Tag Processing

In 2.x we used a home grown tag parser, and we still do, except now it's
extracted into it's own so bugs can be fixed.  And aside from that, it uses
Jekyll style standard syntax, with much more powerful handling of arguments. We
now support array's, hashes, and it looks more like Jekyll.

```liquid
{% asset asset.ext key:subkey=val array=1 array=2 %}
```

## Proxies in SCSS

You can use proxies within `asset_path` and any other helper provided by
Sprockets themselves.  This works the same as the tag arguments, and works the
same as `asset_path` except with extra spaces, this even works with global
(read: `site`) variables, avoiding the Liquid broke my JavaScript problem with
`.css.liquid` or `.liquid.css`, see it in action for yourself

```scss
body {
  background-image: asset_url("'{{ site.bg }}' magick:resize=1200")
}
```


## SourceMaps

We now support SourceMaps.  By default they are only enabled when you have
Sprockets 4.x, and they are external, so you use them in production too, if you
really want, but we disable them in production.

```yaml
assets:
  source_maps: true
```

## Plugins!

You can now customize the defaults.  You can disable any default we create by
shipping `!attrName`, which will tell us you don't want it, or you can add your
own defaults if you want, for example, lets say you want your movies to
autoplay, but you don't want to add `@autoplay` to every single `{% asset %}`.
You can now create a simple plugin, make sure it's required inside of your
Jekyll, and do the following:

```ruby
# Frozen-string-literal: true
# Copyright: 2012 - 2017 - MIT License
# Encoding: utf-8

require "jekyll/assets"

module MyNameSpace
  module Assets
    class Default
      class Video < Jekyll::Assets::Default
        content_types %r!video/[a-zA-Z]+!

        # --
        def set_autoplay
          unless args.key?(:autoplay)
            args[:autoplay] = true
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

## Please Donate

Please remember, I'm trying to make a living on OpenSource, if you like my
software, <a href="#" class="donate" data-stripe-slug="donation">donate</a> if
you can! I never ask people to file pull-requests, and some projects take
considerable time, I have no external funding. I also take paid jobs to fix bugs
in other peoples OpenSource projects, or to take on features, no matter how
large or small.  If you would like to sponsor, please email. Or if you are
looking for a full-time, contract or not, full-stack developer, I'm also
available for hire.
