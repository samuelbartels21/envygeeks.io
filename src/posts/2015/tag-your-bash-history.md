Everybody loves tags now.  You can't even escape them, so why not apply it to
your Bash history? You can actually comment your Bash history the way you do
your source code and like a hash tag they start with a "#":

```bash
echo "hello world" # my hello
# C-r (CTRL/CMD+R)
# my hello
```

Now go about tagging your history.
